# simple-tetris-game
After reading Nick Morgan's book 'JavaScript for Kids'. Work with Canvas, jQuery, keyboard control(arrows), if you hold down the key 'arrow to down', then acceleration. The height of the blocks must not exceed the red line, 10 levels, functions constructors are used. Completely my idea and implementation.
